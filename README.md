community-detection
====================


An overview of this topic can be found in a book chapter by Santo Fortonate which serves as an [overview](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.0612v2.pdf)

	Fortunato S (2010) Book chapter: Community detection in graphs Physics Reports Volume 486, Issues 3–5, Pages 75–174


Here, we implement the community detection algorithm based on the work of Reichard and Bornholdt

###Network Data
	
Initially, the simulation will use the sample data file
	
	email_Enron.txt
	
taken from the [Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/).



###Known Issues

- energy update still incomplete
- network visualization still missing
